# Swamp-Saga
A completely broken and unbalanced mod for Mindustry. But to make up for it, it's fun (I think).

#Welcome to Swamp Saga, a mod that seeks to make your gameplay more fun, funny and a little broken too. I hope you enjoy and have fun. :)

The mod is still in the early stages of its development, so thereâ€™s still not much to see in it. Over time I will bring updates and add more content to it.

-Reminder: To install the mod manually, just cut the "SwampSaga-main" folder and leave it in the "mods" folder located in "Mindustry" on the AppData.
I hope you enjoy :)
